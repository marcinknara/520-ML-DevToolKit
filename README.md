# 520-ML-DevToolKit

https://people.cs.umass.edu/~hconboy/class/2021Spring/CS520/finalProject.pdf

Team TBD: Brett, Marcin, Kyle, Stephen, Joey

As a team we opted to use the third-party analysis toolkit Neptune.AI alongside a typical classification ML project (Neptune.AI). This toolkit allowed us to analyze our ML models and get a better understanding of how different classification models perform on a Spotify tracks dataset from Kaggle.

Data:
The Kaggle dataset can be found in the "data" folder of the repository.

Main executable:
The Python main application can be found in the "src" folder, and run by running the Python file "track-classifier.py"
