# 520-ML-DevToolKit

https://people.cs.umass.edu/~hconboy/class/2021Spring/CS520/finalProject.pdf


TODO:

1. Pick at least 2 toolkits off-the-bat (Neptune & Wights and biases?)
2. Pick 1 (2 at most) datasets to work with
3. "Additionally, the project will involve identifying connections
between such ML development toolkits and Software Engineering topics covered in this course". 

-As easy as seeing the implementations of each function in the toolkits (probably in the documentation) and making a write up for them

4. Deliverables:

-Final presentation (7 minutes) 

-Write up:

-Includes lessons learned, experimental evaluation, and any development artifacts (documentation, version control repo (this repo), etc.)


Alternatively, this project could involve comparing/contrasting two different ML development toolkits on the same data set.
Here are some ML development toolkits. There are many others available.
1. Neptune.ai: https://neptune.ai
2. Weights & Biases: https://wandb.ai/site
3. AI Fairness 360
Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01943
Toolkit: https://aif360.mybluemix.net
4. Fairkit Learn
Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09951
Toolkit: https://pypi.org/project/fairkit-learn/

MidPoint presentation:

** The Problem. ** Tell us what you are going to build. If you are doing a research-focused project, tell us
the research question(s) you will answer. If you are building a system, show us a prototype or describe
the basic functionality and where your work will focus. Keep it focused. One slide. No more than 2
minutes total. Practice what you will say. Put a one-sentence summary on the slide.

** The Design. ** Tell us how you will build what you are building. If you are building a system, tell us what
technology you will use and show us the high–level architecture. If you are doing a research-focused
project, tell us the design of your experiment(s). Again, no more than 2 minutes total. Practice what
you will say. They key is to convince the audience you will succeed.

** The Evaluation. ** Tell us how you will know you succeeded. If you are doing a research-focused
project, tell us what data you will use, how you will know that your results make sense, what statistical
tests you’ll apply, etc. If you are building a system, tell us your testing plan and how you will execute
it. Again, no more than 2 minutes.

** The Plan. ** Tell us (really quickly) what your planned timeline is and each group member’s responsibilities. Do not go into details; just show that you have a plan.
