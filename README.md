# 520-ML-DevToolKit

https://people.cs.umass.edu/~hconboy/class/2021Spring/CS520/finalProject.pdf


TODO:

1. Pick at least 2 toolkits off-the-bat (Neptune & Wights and biases?)
2. Pick 1 (2 at most) datasets to work with
3. "Additionally, the project will involve identifying connections
between such ML development toolkits and Software Engineering topics covered in this course". 

-As easy as seeing the implementations of each function in the toolkits (probably in the documentation) and making a write up for them

4. Deliverables:

-Final presentation    
-Write up
-Includes lessons learned, experimental evaluation, and any development artifacts (documentation, version control repo (this repo), etc.)


Alternatively, this project could involve comparing/contrasting two different ML development toolkits on the same data set.
Here are some ML development toolkits. There are many others available.
1. Neptune.ai: https://neptune.ai
2. Weights & Biases: https://wandb.ai/site
3. AI Fairness 360

4. Fairkit Learn
